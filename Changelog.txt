Added a drop to the Tainted Chicken, the Tainted Feather. Also added a crafting recipe for it.

Added a bunch of console outputs on the starting of the game so that I know exactly when it crashed if it died at startup.
Fixed a bug with the drill of the Rockbreaker that would make it use durability and eventually break when shift-breaking a block.
